Cohesion: isn as the functional relatedness of the elements of a module.

In this chapter we'll shift that meaning a bit and relate cohesion to the forces 
that cause a module, or a class, to change.

- SRP: The Single-Responsibility Principle

Why was it important to separate the responsibilities into separate classes? 
Because each  responsibility is an axis of change. When the requirements change,
that change will be manifest through a change in responsibility amongst the classes. 
If a class assumes more than one responsibility, then there will be more than one reason
for it to change.

If a class has more than one responsibility, then the responsibilities become coupled. 
Changes to one  responsibility may impair or inhibit the ability of the class to meet 
the others. This kind of coupling leads to fragile designs that break in unexpected 
ways when changed.

What Is a Responsibility?

In the context of the SRP, we define a responsibility to be "a reason for change." 
If you can think of more than one motive for changing a class, 
then that class has more than one responsibility. This is sometimes hard to see. We are
accustomed to thinking of responsibility in groups.

An axis of change is an axis of change only if the changes actually occur. 
It is not wise to apply the SRP, or any other principle for that matter, 
if there is no symptom.

At the start of the project, the developers and customers try to identify all the really significant user stories they
can. However, they don't try to identify all user stories. As the project proceeds, the customers will continue to
write new user stories. The flow of user stories will not shut off until the project is over.

Spiking, Splitting, and Velocity:

  Stories that are too large or too small are hard to estimate. Developers tend to underestimate large stories and 
  overestimate small ones. Any story that is too big should be split into pieces that aren't too big. Any story that is too
  small should be merged with other small stories.
  For example, consider the story, "Users can securely transfer money into, out of, and between their
  accounts." This is a big story. Estimating will be hard and probably inaccurate. However, we can split it as follow,
  into many stories that are much easier to estimate:
• Users can log in.
• Users can log out.
• Users can deposit money into their account.
• Users can withdraw money from their account.
• Users can transfer money from their account to another account.
